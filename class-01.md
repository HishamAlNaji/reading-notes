**As you can see in the previous photo HTML describe the structure by a pyramid with homepage (header) at the top and categories with subcategories beneath it (nav bar) then you can find the main and the footer .**


#### HTML uses somthing called elements to Describe the Structure of Pages

**As we can see through the photo HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.**

**HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.**

## Extra Markup :

1. HTML <!DOCTYPE> Declaration : All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

2. HTML Comments : HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code. 

3. HTML id Attribute : The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.

4. HTML class Attribute : The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.

5. HTML Block and Inline Elements : A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

6. Escape Characters : Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## HTML5 Layout :

**HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:**

<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
You can read more about semantic elements in our HTML Semantics chapter.
